# dotfiles
Mi colecci√≥n de dotfiles para sistemas UNIX

Things to do:
    
    - Create script to replicate the dotfiles in HOME.
      This script has to check if each dotfile exists in HOME, backup it
      and create a symlink to the proper file in dotfiles/
      The script has to reside in dotfiles/ and has to be executed every first time.
